# Predicting Property Maintenance Fines for City of Detroit
This project is based on an assigment from Coursera course Applied Machine Learning in Python- University of Michigan. The goal of the project is to predict whether a property maintenance fine will be paid by a violator. The fines are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. Data has been provided to the course through the Detroit Open Data Portal.

The iPython notebook contains description and code for the project.
